# MarchingSquaresAlgorithim
 A unity project to experiment with implimentations of marching squares algorithim. The basic algorithim is functional but not sutible for real time, would probably need to be reimpleneted in a compute shader. Future features include a improved curve drawing techniques and different potentials to draw curves from.
